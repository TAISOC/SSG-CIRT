**Name of Data Breach/Vulnerability**: Adobe ColdFusion is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to weak ACLs

**TAI SOC Advisory Number/ID**: TAISOC/1/02/02/2021

**Date Issued**: 2nd  February, 2021


## Overview:

Adobe ColdFusion fails to properly set ACLs, which can allow an unprivileged Windows user to be able to run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.


## Description:

The Adobe ColdFusion installer fails to set a secure access-control list (ACL) on the default installation directory, such as C:\ColdFusion2021\. By default, unprivileged users can create files in this directory structure, which creates a privilege-escalation vulnerability.


## Impact:

By placing a specially-crafted DLL file in the ColdFusion installation directory, an unprivileged user may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on a Windows system with the vulnerable ColdFusion software installed. See DLL Search Order Hijacking for more details.

## Solution:
Use the Server Auto-Lockdown Installer
By default, ColdFusion does not configure itself securely. In order to secure ColdFusion with respect to service privileges, ACLs, and other attributes, the [ColdFusion Server Auto-Lockdown](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/user-guide.html/coldfusion/using/server-lockdown.ug.html) installer must be installed in addition to installing ColdFusion itself.

Mitigation steps will vary based on the version of ColdFusion being used:

- ColdFusion 2016: Apply the changes outlined in the ColdFusion 2016 Lockdown Guide.
ColdFusion 2018: Run the [ColdFusion 2018 Auto-Lockdown installer](https://www.adobe.com/support/coldfusion/downloads.html#cf2018ldg) and ensure that it completes without error.

- ColdFusion 2021: Run the [ColdFusion 2021 Auto-Lockdown installer](https://www.adobe.com/support/coldfusion/downloads.html#cf2021ldg) and ensure that it completes without error.


## Acknowledgment:

This vulnerability was reported by Will Dormann of the Carnegie Mellon University CERT/CC.
